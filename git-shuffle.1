.Nd randomize timestamps of git commits
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm git-shuffle
.Op Fl a
.Op Fl v
.Ar refspec
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr git-commit 1
utility associates timestamps with each commit.
This exposes coding hours and may be perceived as a privacy violation.
The
.Nm
utility mitigates this pitfall by randomizing timestamps associated with existing commits.
Currently, only the hour of the day is randomized while all other timing information is left in tact.
.Pp
As Git timestamps are part of the commit object, doing so requires
.Nm
to rewrite the existing Git history.
Two approaches are supported for doing so:
.Bl -diag -offset indent
.It Rebasing
This is the default strategy, it rebases all commits according to the
given
.Ar refspec .
The
.Ar refspec
syntax is further described in
.Xr gitrevisions 7 .
.It Amending
Contrary to rebasing, this strategy only modifies the tip of the current branch.
Primarily intended to be used from
.Xr githooks 5 .
.El
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Amend the tip of the branch instead of rebasing.
This causes the
.Ar refspec
argument to be ignored.
.It Fl v
Activate verbose output.
For each modified commit write the commit hash to standard output.
